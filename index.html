            <p> So, how does the gasoline engine work? Before we start naming parts, we should understand that just like us, <span class="bigidea">cars need fuel and air</span> in order to generate the energy to move around, too.</p>

            <p>So, let's <em>dive in</em>! Check out the video* titled "How the gasoline engine works." </p>

            <p>After you've finished, read <a href="http://www.hoentaylor.com/blog/?tag=how-an-internal-combustion-engine-works" target="_blank">this excellent blog post</a> which describes how the internal combustion engine works using things you already understand. In the post, Hoen Taylor describes the basic parts of the engine in terms of a tricycle wheel, a spray bottle, a syringe, and a bathroom sink. These simple elements can be used to describe the <span class="bigidea">four stroke cycle</span> of the internal combustion engine.</p>

            <p>
              In the Fuel and Air section, you read a little bit about the spark plug and electric starter motor on <a href="http://www.hoentaylor.com/blog/?tag=how-an-internal-combustion-engine-works">Taylor Hoen's blog</a>. This part of the lesson showed how gasoline burns best when mixed thoroughly with air. However, it needs a spark of electricity to do it! Watch the video, "Starting a Car - Explained," to understand just how that spark happens when you start your car.

              If you've ever owned a car, you've had to get an oil change. Some mechanics are courteous enough to leave a sticker on your dashboard to remind you approximately when or at what mileage you should come back to change your oil. Why?

            <p>
              Well, did you know that each of the joints in the human body contains a <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/synovial-fluid-analysis" target="_blank">lubricating fluid</a>? This allows for ease of movement of the body. Engine oil serves a similar purpose.
